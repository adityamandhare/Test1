Hello,
Thank you for inviting me for a phone interview. I wanted to ask if we can schedule this interview next week. Owing to Career Fair at NCSU and my class test this week, its difficult to schedule an interview in the mentioned time slot. However, next week I am available at any time slot from Monday to Friday. It would be great if we could schedule the phone interview on 8th February (Monday).

I hope you consider my request. Awaiting your kind reply.

Thanks and Regards,
Aditya Mandhare
