Paper 1: Objective Emotional Assessment of Industrial Products
The paper uses an Objective Emotional Assessment (OEA) technique, which is an application of psychophysiology to elicit the differences in the emotional and arousing effects of cosmetic products. It can be clearly understood from the paper that the OEA is much better than the traditional techniques. Not only does it differentiate between the physical properties of the products bu also reveals their emotion inducing properties. The paper presents three experiments wherein it deals with consumer's experience with cosmetic products and their emotion inducing effect to demonstrate the OEA.
